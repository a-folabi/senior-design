# Team 7: Emerson Wants to Play Baseball
Emerson is a 12 year old girl with cerebral palsy. As a result, she has limited motor controls.
This project is an undertaking to give emerson the ability to play catch with her mom and friends despite her condition. 
We are building a remote controlled baseball tossing device which would give emerson the ability to change the direction of her toss, 
adjust the power and slightly modify the angle of her toss.
